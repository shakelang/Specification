On this site you can find the specification published for Shake. It is still work in progress, most of the things are not documented. Consider taking a look at the dokka documentation for shake.
It can be located at https://shakelang.github.io/dokka/{{PACKAGEPATH}}/index.html (replace {{PACKAGE}} with the package you want to look at, for example `util/primitives`, `util/common-io`, `util/parseutils`, `util/lexer`)
