# DataInputStream

An input stream that expands the data reading capabilities of another input stream.

## The `DataInputStream` class

The `DataInputStream` class is a subclass of `InputStream` that reads data from an underlying input stream and provides additional methods for reading primitive data types.

```kotlin
val inputStream: InputStream = ...
val dataStream = inputStream.dataStream
```

It has all the methods of the `InputStream` class.

## Additional methods

The `DataInputStream` class provides additional methods for reading primitive data types:

- `readByte()`: Reads a signed 8-bit integer
- `readShort()`: Reads a signed 16-bit integer in big-endian byte order.
- `readShortBE()`: Reads a signed 16-bit integer in big-endian byte order.
- `readShortLE()`: Reads a signed 16-bit integer in little-endian byte order.
- `readInt()`: Reads a signed 32-bit integer in big-endian byte order.
- `readIntBE()`: Reads a signed 32-bit integer in big-endian byte order.
- `readIntLE()`: Reads a signed 32-bit integer in little-endian byte order.
- `readLong()`: Reads a signed 64-bit integer in big-endian byte order.
- `readLongBE()`: Reads a signed 64-bit integer in big-endian byte order.
- `readLongLE()`: Reads a signed 64-bit integer in little-endian byte order.
- `readFloat()`: Reads a 32-bit floating point number in big-endian byte order.
- `readFloatBE()`: Reads a 32-bit floating point number in big-endian byte order.
- `readFloatLE()`: Reads a 32-bit floating point number in little-endian byte order.
- `readDouble()`: Reads a 64-bit floating point number in big-endian byte order.
- `readDoubleBE()`: Reads a 64-bit floating point number in big-endian byte order.
- `readDoubleLE()`: Reads a 64-bit floating point number in little-endian byte order.
- `readUTF(amount: Int)`: Reads a UTF-8 encoded string of the specified length.
- `readUTF()`: Reads a UTF-8 encoded string (length is prefixed as a unsigned 16-bit integer (big-endian) (ushort)).
- `readUTF8(amount: Int)`: Reads a UTF-8 encoded string of the specified length.
- `readUTF8()`: Reads a UTF-8 encoded string (length is prefixed as a unsigned 16-bit integer (big-endian) (ushort)).
- `readUTF16(amount: Int)`: Reads a UTF-16 encoded string of the specified length.
- `readUTF16()`: Reads a UTF-16 encoded string (length is prefixed as a unsigned 16-bit integer (big-endian) (ushort)).

## Example

```kotlin
val inputStream = ByteArrayInputStream(byteArrayOf(0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x00, 0x0B, 0x68, 0x65, 0x6c, 0x6c, 0x6f, 0x20, 0x77, 0x6f, 0x72, 0x6c, 0x64))
val dataStream = inputStream.dataStream
val magic = dataStream.readInt() // 0x01020304
val string = dataStream.readUTF() // "hello world"
```
