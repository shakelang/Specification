# Shake Variables

Variables in shake are defined using the `var` and `val` keywords.
`var` is used to define a variable that can be reassigned,
while `val` is used to define a variable that cannot be reassigned.

## § 1 Variable Declaration

### § 1.1 `var` Keyword

The `var` keyword is used to declare a variable that can be reassigned.
The syntax is as follows:

```shake
var variableName: Type = value
```

### § 1.2 `val` Keyword

The `val` keyword is used to declare a variable that cannot be reassigned.

```shake
val variableName: Type = value
```

## § 2 Variable Types

### § 2.1 Primitive Types

Shake supports the following builtin (primitive) data types:

- `byte` - 8-bit signed integer
- `short` - 16-bit signed integer
- `int` - 32-bit signed integer
- `long` - 64-bit signed integer
- `float` - 32-bit floating point number
- `double` - 64-bit floating point number
- `ubyte` - 8-bit unsigned integer
- `ushort` - 16-bit unsigned integer
- `uint` - 32-bit unsigned integer
- `ulong` - 64-bit unsigned integer
- `char` - 16-bit unicode character (UTF-16)
- `boolean` - boolean value

### § 2.2 Custom Types

Custom types can be defined using the `class` keyword.

```shake
class ClassName {
    // class body
}
```

### § 2.3 Type Inference

Shake supports type inference, which means that you don't have to specify the type of a variable explicitly.
The type of the variable is inferred from the value assigned to it.

```shake
var x = 10 // x is of type int
val y = "Hello" // y is of type string
```

### Common Types / Structures

- `String` - A sequence of characters
- `Array<T>` - An array of elements of type `T`
  _Note_ Arrays are not implemented via a built-in type, but are instead implemented as a library type.

## § 3 Variable Scope

Variables in shake have block scope.
This means that a variable declared inside a block is only accessible within that block.

```shake
{
    var x = 10
    println(x) // 10
}
```

## § 4 Constants

Constants are declared using the `const` keyword.
A constant is a variable whose value cannot be changed once it is assigned.

```shake
const val PI: double = 3.14159
```

## § 5 Nullability

By default, variables in shake are non-nullable.
This means that a variable cannot be assigned a `null` value unless it is explicitly declared as nullable.

```shake
var x: int? = null
```

## § 6 Type Casting

Type casting is the process of converting a variable from one type to another.
Shake supports both implicit and explicit type casting.

### § 6.1 Implicit Type Casting

Implicit type casting is done automatically by the compiler when it is safe to do so.

```shake
var x: int = 10
var y: double = x // Implicit type casting
```

### § 6.2 Explicit Type Casting

Explicit type casting is done manually by the programmer using the `as` keyword.

```shake
var x: double = 10.5
var y: int = x as int // Explicit type casting
```

## § 7 Type Checking

Type checking is the process of verifying that a variable is of a certain type.
Shake supports the `is` operator for type checking.

```shake
var x: int = 10
if (x is int) {
    println("x is an integer")
}
```
