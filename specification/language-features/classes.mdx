# Classes, Interfaces, and Inheritance

## § 1 Classes

### § 1.1 Introduction

A class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure),
providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes),
and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).
The user-defined objects are created using the class keyword.

```shake
class Animal {
  // ...
}
```

### § 1.2 Class Members

A class can contain the following members:

- Fields
- Methods
- Constructors

### § 1.3 Fields

Fields are variables that belong to an object.
They can be of any data type.

```shake
class Animal {
  val name: String
  var age: Int
}
```

### § 1.4 Methods

Methods are functions that belong to an object.
They can be of any data type.

See [Functions](functions) for more information about methods and functions.

```shake
class Animal {
  fun makeSound(): String {
    return "Animal sound"
  }
}
```

### § 1.5 Constructors

A constructor is a special member function that is called when an object is created.
It is used to initialize the object.

```shake
class Animal {

  val name: String
  var age: Int

  constructor(name: String, age: Int) {
    this.name = name
    this.age = age
  }
}
```

#### § 1.5.1 Constructor overloading

A class can have multiple constructors with different parameters.
This is called constructor overloading.

```shake
class Animal {

  val name: String
  var age: Int

  constructor(name: String, age: Int) {
    this.name = name
    this.age = age
  }

  constructor(name: String) {
    this.name = name
    this.age = 0
  }
}
```

#### § 1.5.2 Named constructors

In addition a class can have named constructors. This might be helpfull when you want to
create a constructor with a different functionality, but same parameters as the default constructor.
It also helps with implicit documentation.

```shake
class Animal {

  val name: String
  var age: Int

  constructor(name: String, age: Int) {
    this.name = name
    this.age = age
  }

  constructor newBorn(name: String) {
    this.name = name
    this.age = 0
  }
}
```

#### § 1.5.3 Primary constructor

A class can have a primary constructor that is defined in the class header.
The primary constructor can have default values for parameters.
In this case, the primary constructor MUST be referenced in the secondary constructors.

```shake
class Animal(val name: String, var age: Int = 0) {
  // ...
}
```

To add a body to the primary constructor, you can use the `init` block.

```shake

class Animal(val name: String, var age: Int = 0) {
  init {
    println("Animal $name created")
  }
}
```

### § 1.6 Inheritance

Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires the properties and behavior of another class.
The class that inherits the properties and behavior is called the subclass or derived class.
The class whose properties and behavior are inherited is called the superclass or base class.

A class can ONLY inherit from one superclass.

```shake

class Animal {
  fun makeSound(): String {
    return "Animal sound"
  }
}

class Dog: Animal {
  fun makeSound(): String {
    return "Dog barks"
  }
}
```

#### § 1.6.1 Inheritance with constructors

When a class inherits from another class, it must call the constructor of the superclass.

```shake
class Animal(val name: String) {
  fun makeSound(): String {
    return "Animal sound"
  }
}

class Dog(name: String): Animal(name) {
  fun makeSound(): String {
    return "Dog barks"
  }
}
```

#### § 1.6.2 Overriding methods

A subclass can provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by its superclass.
This is called method overriding.

```shake
class Animal {
  fun makeSound(): String {
    return "Animal sound"
  }
}

class Dog: Animal {
  override fun makeSound(): String {
    return "Dog barks"
  }
}
```

#### § 1.6.3 Accessing superclass methods

A subclass can access the methods of its superclass using the `super` keyword.

```shake
class Animal {
  fun makeSound(): String {
    return "Animal sound"
  }
}

class Dog: Animal {
  override fun makeSound(): String {
    return super.makeSound() + " and Dog barks"
  }
}
```

#### § 1.6.4 Final methods

A method can be marked as `final` to prevent it from being overridden in a subclass.

```shake
class Animal {
  final fun makeSound(): String {
    return "Animal sound"
  }
}

class Dog: Animal {

  // This will cause a compilation error
  override fun makeSound(): String {
    return "Dog barks"
  }
}
```

### 1.7 Abstract classes

An abstract class is a class that cannot
be instantiated and is used to define the structure of other classes.
It can contain abstract methods that must be implemented by the subclass.

```shake
abstract class Animal {
  abstract fun makeSound(): String
}
```

## § 2 Interfaces

An interface is a contract that defines the behavior of a class.
It contains abstract methods that must be implemented by the class that implements the interface.

```shake
interface Animal {
  fun makeSound(): String
}
```

### § 2.1 Implementing an interface

A class can implement an interface by using the `:` symbol followed by the interface name.

```shake
class Dog: Animal {
  fun makeSound(): String {
    return "Dog barks"
  }
}
```

### § 2.2 Multiple interfaces

A class can implement multiple interfaces by separating them with a comma in addition to the superclass.

```shake
class Animal {
  fun makeSound(): String {
    return "Animal sound"
  }
}

interface Pet {
  fun play(): String
}

interface Walk {
  fun walk(): String
}

class Dog: Animal, Pet, Walk {
  fun makeSound(): String {
    return "Dog barks"
  }

  fun play(): String {
    return "Dog plays"
  }

  fun walk(): String {
    return "Dog walks"
  }
}
```

### § 2.3 Default methods

An interface can have default methods that are implemented in the interface.
A class that implements the interface can override the default method.

```shake

interface Animal {
  fun makeSound(): String {
    return "Animal sound"
  }
}

```

Note: Interface defaults are always open and cannot be marked as `final`.
Note: In case of multiple default implementations, the class must override the method.
Example:

```shake
interface Animal {
  fun makeSound(): String {
    return "Animal sound"
  }
}

interface Pet {
  fun makeSound(): String {
    return "Pet sound"
  }
}

class Dog: Animal, Pet {
  override fun makeSound(): String {
    return super@Animal.makeSound() + " and " + super@Pet.makeSound()
  }
}
```
